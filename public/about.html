<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently working as a Senior Systems Engineer at Eir Evo. As an MSP, we look after over 300 plus customers across Europe region. <br />
  Some of my responsibilities are to provide level 3 support, 
  fault finding on host machine (VMware/Hyper-V), taking ownership of projects, and delivering them on time, 
  and I have been the go-to engineer when it comes with PowerShell scripting.</p>

<p>In my resume, you will find a solid background about me. 
  I believe this background provides the necessary experience you require for 
  the current role. I would welcome the opportunity to speak with you in person 
  or through video call about my career possibilities with the company. 
  Thank you for your time and consideration</p>
